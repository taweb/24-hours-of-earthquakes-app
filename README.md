# 24 Hours of Earthquakes App

## A React Native mobile app built using Redux, Axios and Redux Thunk middleware.

To further practice React Native and making api requests, I decided to make an earthquake tracker app, similar to an app I have had on my phone in the past. It fetches the last 24 hours of earthquakes from the US Geological Survey API (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) and first displays featured earthquake events on the home page "dashboard" tab (largest earthquake in last 24 hours and the most recent earthquake). The user can also click through to the full screen map tab, where all of the last 24 hours of earthquakes are plotted, with further information for a particular event displayed in a callout when selected. By building this app I gained experience implementing tab based navigation and using the React Native Map plugin and components.

You will need to have the Expo client installed to view the app. Documentation for the client can be found here: https://expo.io/tools#client
